Generates a sheet of affirmations you can print, cut, and use to make tea bags. It's like yogi tea. But for Eva.

Make your own affirmations:

1. Modify `./data/affirmation_template.txt`
1. Name it `affirmations.txt`

Generate the output:

* Run the sketch from processing
OR
* Run in the terminal `processing-java --sketch=/path/to/sketch_folder --run`

The output is saved under `.out/render.pdf` and the canevas does not show.

To do:

- [ ] Add CLI: path for output / Font to use?
- [ ] Add multi-page support?
